GeneBlocks is a Python library for comparing DNA sequences. It can be used to:

- Find common blocks in a group of DNA sequences, to factorize them (e.g. only analyze or synthetize each common block once).
- Highlight differences between sequences (insertions, deletions, mutations).
- Transfer Genbank features from one record to another sharing similar subsequences.

At the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, we use GeneBlocks to optimize sequence assembly, explore sets of non-annotated sequences, or visualize the differences
between different versions of a sequence, and re-annotate records coming from third parties such as DNA manufacturers.
